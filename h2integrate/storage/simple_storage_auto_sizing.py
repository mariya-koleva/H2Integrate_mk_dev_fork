        2) Estimate the storage SOC (in `commodity_amount_units`) as the cumulative summation of

            negative when charging and positive when discharging. The SOC increases when charging

        Iterates through ``storage_dispatch_commands`` one timestep at a time.
        A negative command requests charging; a positive command requests
        discharging.  Each command is clipped to the most restrictive of three
        limits before it is applied:

        1. **SOC headroom** - the remaining capacity (charge) or remaining
           stored commodity (discharge), converted to a rate via
           ``storage_capacity / dt_hr``.
        2. **Hardware rate limit** - ``charge_rate`` or ``discharge_rate``,
           divided by the corresponding efficiency so the limit is expressed
           in pre-efficiency rate units.
        3. **Commanded magnitude** - the absolute value of the dispatch command
           itself (we never exceed what was asked for).

        After clipping, the result is scaled by the charge or discharge
        efficiency to obtain the actual commodity flow into or out of the
        storage, and the SOC is updated accordingly.

        This method is separated from ``compute()`` so the Pyomo dispatch
